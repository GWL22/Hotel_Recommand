Expedia Hotel Recommandations
==============================

This was one of [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/)'s competition;
[Expedia Hotel Recommandations](https://www.kaggle.com/c/expedia-hotel-recommendations)

It's written for Python 2.7.2 and it's based on ['scikit-learn'](http://scikit-learn.org/)

Project Description
---------------------
It was made to improve recommendation algorithm of Expedia hotel recommendation system.
Expedia wanted to predict which hotel cluster user would belong to.

'**Ensemble_hotel_cluster.py**' is the result to solve the problem.
It was very difficult to find proper model and columns combinations.
In addition, Prediction Accuracy (0.30) is too low to judge it works.

However, train dataset has some specific regularities between them;

- user_location_country: The ID of the country the customer is located
- hotel_country: Hotel country
- srch_destination_id: ID of the destination where the hotel search was performed
- nights: How long they hope to stay in hotel
- prepare: How much time they are prepared beforehand

Finally, the target was changed 'hotel cluster' to 'is_package'.

'is_package' can be predicted by DecisionTreeClassifier at 90%.

The code file is '**DTC_find_package.py**'

The train file, however, is too big to upload github.
I leave a link where you can download the train file.
There are four files on the web site and only one of them used.
